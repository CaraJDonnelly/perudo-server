perudo-server

This is a simple server program which implements the game Perudo.  To start a game with four players, run the server as follows

user> perudo-server -p 4

and the server will then listen on the socket given in perudo-server.conf.  When all clients have joined a random order will be assigned and the game will begin.  The server rolls the dice and communicates all public actions to all players.

To run the server in verbose mode use the flag -v.  This will print the result of each round et cetera.

To run the server in very verbose mode use the flag -vv.  This will print out bids et cetera as they are made.

To run the server in very very verbose mode use the flag -vvv.  This will print out all function calls.
